    headline: "Asteroid",
    detail: "Asteroids are generally larger chunks of rock that come from the asteroid belt located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Sometimes their orbits get perturbed or altered and some asteroids end up coming closer to the Sun, and therefore closer to Earth."

    detail: "There are stark differences between asteroids, meteors and comets. Comets are much like asteroids, but might have a more ice, methane, ammonia, and other compounds that develop a fuzzy, cloud-like shell called a coma – as well as a tail — when it gets closer to the Sun.",

    headline: "Asteroids v. Meteors",
    detail: "Space debris smaller than an asteroid are called meteoroids. A meteoroid is a piece of interplanetary matter that is smaller than a kilometer and frequently only millimeters in size. If they enter Earth’s atmosphere, they gain a different name: Meteor, or as sometimes known, a 'shooting star'. A meteor is the flash of light that we see in the night sky when a small chunk of interplanetary debris burns up as it passes through our atmosphere. If any part of a meteoroid survives the fall through the atmosphere and lands on Earth, it is called a meteorite. Although the vast majority of meteorites are very small, their size can range from about a fraction of a gram (the size of a pebble) to 100 kilograms (220 lbs) or more (the size of a huge, life-destroying boulder)."

    headline: "Discovery",
    detail: "In 1801, Giuseppe Piazzi discovered what he believed to be a new planet. He named the newfound object Ceres, after the Roman goddess of the harvest. Soon after Ceres’ discovery similar objects were found. It was soon realized that these new objects were not, in fact, planets, but some other type of celestial body. One characteristic these objects shared was their resemblance to distant stars as viewed through the telescopes of the time. As a result of their similar appearance to stars the objects were named asteroids (meaning 'star shaped') by astronomer William Herschel.",

    headline: "Asteroid Belt",
    detail: "The majority of the known asteroids in the Solar System orbit the Sun in a band between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. This band is commonly referred to as the Asteroid Belt. Although there are hundreds of thousands of asteroids in the Asteroid Belt, there are only around 200 known that exceed 100 km in diameter, making the majority of the asteroids realtively small objects.",

  { 
    headline: "Beginnings",
    detail: "Current theories suggests that the asteroids found in the Asteroid Belt are the remnants of a planet that failed to form during the development of the Solar System. More specifically, it is believed that when Jupiter formed its huge mass and gravitational pull disrupted the material in the Asteroid Belt to accrete, or join together, to form into a planet. If all the material in the Asteroid Belt were to be combined, the resulting object’s diameter is projected to be at most about half that of Earth’s moon.",

The soot and dust of the impact and fires creates an “impact winter” lasting for many years, leading to the death of all dinosaurs and many other forms of life." ,
