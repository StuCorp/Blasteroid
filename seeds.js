    fact_detail: "Space debris smaller than an asteroid are called meteoroids. A meteoroid is a piece of interplanetary matter that is smaller than a kilometer and frequently only millimeters in size. If they enter Earth’s atmosphere, they gain a different name: Meteor, or as sometimes known, a shooting star. A meteor is the flash of light that we see in the night sky when a small chunk of interplanetary debris burns up as it passes through our atmosphere. If any part of a meteoroid survives the fall through the atmosphere and lands on Earth, it is called a meteorite. Although the vast majority of meteorites are very small, their size can range from about a fraction of a gram (the size of a pebble) to 100 kilograms (220 lbs) or more (the size of a huge, life-destroying boulder).",

Soon after Ceres discovery similar objects were found. It was soon realized that these new objects were not, in fact, planets, but some other type of celestial body. One characteristic these objects shared was their resemblance to distant stars as viewed through the telescopes of the time. As a result of their similar appearance to stars the objects were named asteroids meaning star shaped by astronomer William Herschel.",

More specifically, it is believed that when Jupiter formed its huge mass and gravitational pull disrupted the material in the Asteroid Belt to accrete, or join together, to form into a planet. If all the material in the Asteroid Belt were to be combined, the resulting object’s diameter is projected to be at most about half that of Earth’s moon.",
